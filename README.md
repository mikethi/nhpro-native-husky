## Downloadable bundle zip

Create a zip with all tracked repository files plus every HTTP(S) link referenced by those files:

```bash
python3 scripts/create_repo_bundle_zip.py
```

The zip is written to `dist/repo-and-links.zip`.

A GitHub Actions workflow (`Repository Bundle Zip`) also uploads the same zip as a downloadable artifact on pushes and manual runs:
